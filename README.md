*** Read me before contribute HTTP Pokémon Status Project! ***

Image should be...
* Animated gif, on the httppkmn/
* From the <b>official anime</b> (main series, movie, mystery dungeon...), but not fanart.
* Original (exception:418 teapot;but a little change)
* <b>National Pokédex number == HTTP Status Number</b>. Should be the main character from the National Dex.
* Something, which represents the corresponding 'status'.

We recommend...
* Not too large, not too small. (preview 200*180)
* Not too long scene
* Width is a bit longer than height.
* No big gif maker things watermark (OK if it's small), but channel names from TV are allowed.
* To main Pokémon is big or on center that can be found easily. (can have some exceptions, too)

Thumbnails:
* 200x180 cropped and not animated gif file from original, on the httppkmn/thumbs
* We recommend to make thumbnails manually to catch the best scene.
* Best scene means picture, which represents the status well.
* Don't need to place the Pokémon to very center, but the character on the picture should be shown.

Others
* We <b>do allow</b> to be with other Pokémons and trainers. The other Pokémons'/trainers' size can be equal or a little bigger than the main pokémon. The other one may look like a main Pokémon, but you don't need to care about it, because we make clear what's the main Pokémon (from national dex number).
* <b>Don't mind the storyline.</b> For example, such complains are not accepted: "No response? It reacted, of course!"


You may make the thumbnail and edit the html to add picture to help us, but I can add it too, when the original picture is uploaded.
You can fix technical and grammar issues, too.
