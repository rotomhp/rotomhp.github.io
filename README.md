*** Read me before contribute HTTP Pokémon Status Project! ***
Image should be...
* Animated gif
* From the <b>official anime</b> (main series, movie, mystery dungeon...), but not fanart.
* Original (exception:418 teapot;but a little change)
* <b>National Pokédex number == HTTP Status Number</b>. Should be the main character from the National Dex.
* Something, which represents the corresponding 'status'.

We recommand...
* Not too large, not too small. (preview 200*180)
* Width is a bit longer than height.
* No big gif maker things watermark (OK if it's small), but channel names from TV are allowed.
* To main Pokémon is big or on center that can be found easily. (can have some exceptions, too)

Others
* We <b>do allow</b> to be with other Pokémons and trainers. The other Pokémons'/trainers' size can be equal or a little bigger than the main pokémon. The other one may look like a main Pokémon, but you don't need to care about it, because we make clear what's the main Pokémon (from national dex number).
* <b>Don't mind the storyline.</b> For example, such complains are not accepted: "No response? It reacted, of course!"
